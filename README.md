# CRUD interface for database

The purpose of this project is to implement a web application for managing a database of Books and Genres. 
The included functionalities are those described by the CRUD acronym, namely Create (Add), Read (View/Display), Update (Edit/Modify), and Delete (Remove).
The above-mentioned operations must be applicable to all tables in the database, meaning the Books table, Genres table, and the many-to-many (M:N) relationship table.

The app was implemented using a Python Django framework and MySql database.
